### Week 2 Challenge

String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z). 



### Weekly Challenges

#### Code Challenges

Each week there is one to three coding challenges.  Make a new file with your initials and the week (ra_week_1.rb) with your solution.

#### Technical and Behavioral Questions

Each will also include a selection of technical and behavioral questions.  At the bottom of your solution file answer these questions (use comments) to the degree you are most comfortable with.  Honor system - answer these prior to any research, as if you were asked on the spot in an interview.

For behavioral questions a few notes will be enough (perhaps keep a longer form of you answer in a journal of some kind) - Try and organize your thoughts using the STAR method - Situation, Task, Action, Result.
